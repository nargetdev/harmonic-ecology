## Harmonic Ecology

Hello, and welcome to project Harmonic Ecology!

Harmonic Ecology is an effort to interpret as sound and index the energetic waveforms of our wholistic ecology, which includes society at large, to be interpretted and understood as music.  Because it is music.

Harmony is tangible objective reality as much as it is subjective experience.  This project is an attempt to close that gap.
